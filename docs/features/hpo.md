# Hyperparameter optimization

MORL-Baselines contains an early solution to the problem of hyperparameter optimization for MORL.
The problem and solution are introduced and discussed in the following paper:
[F. Felten, D. Gareev, E.-G. Talbi, and G. Danoy, “Hyperparameter Optimization for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning.” arXiv, Oct. 25, 2023. doi: 10.48550/arXiv.2310.16487.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16487)


A script to launch the hyperparameter sweep is available in [`benchmark/launch_experiment.py`](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/morl-baselines/experiments/hyperparameter_search/launch_sweep.py).
